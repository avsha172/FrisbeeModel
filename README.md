# Frisbee Trajectory Predictor

This project is designed to simulate and predict the trajectory of a Frisbee in flight, visualizing the path it would take given certain initial conditions.

## Overview

The Frisbee Trajectory Predictor uses physics principles to compute the flight path of a Frisbee, producing graphs that illustrate the expected trajectory. The code takes into account various factors such as the initial throw velocity, angle, and the Frisbee's aerodynamic properties.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The script is written in Python. Make sure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Frisbee-Trajectory-Predictor.git
