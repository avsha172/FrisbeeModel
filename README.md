Frisbee Trajectory Predictor
This project is designed to simulate and predict the trajectory of a Frisbee in flight, visualizing the path it would take given certain initial conditions.

Overview
The Frisbee Trajectory Predictor uses physics principles to compute the flight path of a Frisbee, producing graphs that illustrate the expected trajectory. The code takes into account various factors such as the initial throw velocity, angle, and the Frisbee's aerodynamic properties.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
The script is written in Python. Make sure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

Installation
Clone the repo:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Frisbee-Trajectory-Predictor.git
Install the required Python libraries. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and run:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before installing the required libraries.

Usage
To run the script, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will start the program and generate the trajectory graphs for a Frisbee's flight.
