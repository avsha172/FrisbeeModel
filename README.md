# Frisbee Trajectory Predictor

This project is designed to simulate and predict the trajectory of a Frisbee in flight, visualizing the path it would take given certain initial conditions.

## Overview

The Frisbee Trajectory Predictor uses physics principles to compute the flight path of a Frisbee, producing graphs that illustrate the expected trajectory. The code takes into account various factors such as the initial throw velocity, angle, and the Frisbee's aerodynamic properties.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The script is written in Python. Make sure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/Frisbee-Trajectory-Predictor.git

2. Install the required Python libraries. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Note:** If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before installing the required libraries.

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and run:

python main.py

This will start the program and generate the trajectory graphs for a Frisbee's flight.
